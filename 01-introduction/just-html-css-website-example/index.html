        This is a simple website, put together using just HTML and CSS. It's surprising how much you can do with just
        these two technologies!

    <h2 id="html-section">How does HTML work? ü§î</h2>
    <p>
        An HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) document outlines the <strong>structure</strong> of a web page using
        <strong>tags</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tags in an HTML document tell the
        browser how to display our text, images, and links. For example, there are several different tags that represent
        text headings, similar to the different headings you might use in a Word document. They are called
        <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, etc.
        There is also a tag for paragraph text, like the text you are reading right now. This tag is simply called
        <code>p</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tag syntax helps the browser to
        understand what structure you'd like the webpage to have - where headings start and end, and where paragraphs
        begin and finish. Like this:
    <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt; Example Heading &lt;/h1&gt;</br>&lt;p&gt; This is an example of paragraph text &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see that the starting tag looks like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> whereas the closing tag looks like
        <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>. The <code>/</code> represents the closing tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add images, we use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Unlike paragraphs and headings, we can close within
        the same tag for images. For example, the code for the image below is:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;img class=&quot;main-page-image&quot; src=&quot;https://picsum.photos/id/16/2000/1000&quot; alt=&quot;My test image&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>

    <img class="main-page-image" src="https://picsum.photos/id/16/2000/1000" alt="My test image" />
    <!-- Sample image from https://picsum.photos/ -->

    </br>

    <p>
        This highlights the slight differences in syntax between tags. It's okay if you don't remember these off the top
        of your head. Even developers with a lot of experience find themselves Googling things about HTML tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using just HTML alone, you can create a readable webpage. However, CSS can help us
        add <strong>styling</strong>. This can further enhance readability and generally make the page look a lot
        more appealing!

    <h2 id="css-section">How does CSS work? ü§î</h2>

    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows us to describe <strong>how</strong> we want our page to look using
        <strong>rulesets</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rulesets, often referred to as just rules, allow us to describe what we want specific elements of our HTML
        document to look like. They look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>p { colour: red };</code></pre>
    <p>
        In this example, we are saying we want all paragraphs to have red text. <code>p</code> is the CSS 'selector' and
        maps
        directly to our HTML tag, <code>color</code> is the property we are defining, <code>red</code> is value we want
        to assign the property.
    </p>
